# BigBang
Problem:
There was a tale when 2 prime numbers collided and a big bang happened. Scientists found out the 2 prime numbers are 3 and 5 but they need a model to generate an array of numbers to predict when the big bang will happen again.
Solution:
Create a script to iterate through 1 to 100 and replace any number divisible by 3 with the word BIG number divisible by 5 with the word BANG. If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, replace it with BIG BANG. Generate the array and output to ‘output.json’ file with result as follow:

[“1”, “2”, “BIG”, “4”, “BANG”, “BIG”, “7”, “8”, “BIG”, “BANG”, “11”, “BIG”, “13”, “14”, “BIGBANG”, .... all the way to 100]

How to run the script:
1. Open bigbang.py file and run file
2. output will appear in output.json file
